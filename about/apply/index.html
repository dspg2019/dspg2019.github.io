<h1 id="program-overview-why-apply-to-dspg">Program Overview: Why Apply to DSPG?</h1>

<p>Delivered by the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at the University of Virginia, SDAD&rsquo;s Data Science for the Public Good program (DSPG) offers a range of unique opportunities to aspiring scholars and future data science practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>Make a real impact.</strong> Our student fellows participate in all the laboratory’s project activities &ndash;— research that’s fundamentally transforming the way we understand the world. As part of the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative of the University of Virginia, our projects help guide the creation of resilient cities, inform effective policy responses to public health crises, and uncover key factors that drive industrial innovation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of our projects involved interesting issues with a clear need for statistical expertise, and a direct impact on the communities we worked with.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;All of our projects involved interesting issues with a clear need for statistical expertise, and a direct impact on the communities we worked with.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Diversify your expertise.</strong> Our students work in cross-disciplinary teams, closely supported by graduate teaching and research assistants and supervised by faculty. Your colleagues and mentors will be thought leaders in a wide variety of fields: statistics, social, behavioral and economic sciences, computer science, simulation, data analytics, information technology policy, and infrastructural resilience.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;We never felt limited by our individual skill sets because collaboration provided so many natural opportunities for us to learn from one another. Colleagues with a background in statistics would teach those of us with experience in computer programming and vice versa.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Form professional connections.</strong> Our laboratory is located in Arlington County, just a few miles west of Washington DC. Student fellows will have the opportunity to interact with decision-makers in industry and government agencies and attend policy events on Capitol Hill and the surrounding area.</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The interdisciplinary work environment made it easy to connect and have conversations. If I wanted to ask a question about another field of research, there was always a door I could knock on.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
